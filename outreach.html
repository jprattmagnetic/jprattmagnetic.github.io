          title="Astro Fluids.  Narrative: This piece is meant to
          represent the turbulent and laminar flows of plasma fluid
          movement within stars. Watercolor was chosen as the main
          medium due to the spontaneous and fluid nature of the paints;
          they can facilitate capturing the difference between the two
          flows within the star. The dark, condensed masses within the
          painting symbolize the laminar flows while the light and
          textured areas represent the turbulent flows also present
          within the star. These fluid movements are influenced by heat
          and interactions with other particles; these interactions make
          the fluid movement unique as represented by the three distinct
          snap shots of the system.  Dr. Jane Pratt and Mary Geer
          Dethero work on astrophysical plasmas. Plasma, the so-called
          “fourth state of matter,” occurs when gasses become so hot
          that their constituent atoms ionize. Plasma is the material
          that makes up the stars, as well as the material between the
          stars. They study the fluid movements of plasmas as they
          interact with heat and other particles, and as they form
          turbulent flows, jets, shock waves, and convective plumes.
          These processes change how stars evolve over long periods of
          time, how magnetic fields are generated, and how material and
          radiation travel across large distances." alt=""

		  <p> Narrative: Fusion promises a sustainable energy source for the
future. A section of a fusion reactor, shaped like a torus,
is shown in the background of this image. In a fusion
reactor, plasma is trapped long enough for ions to fuse
together and produce energy. However the magnetic
fields that trap the plasma can produce instabilities. Here
a cross-section shows the plasma pressure in a realistic
tokamak reactor configuration, affected by a tearing
instability. The tearing instability produces a magnetic
island, which is evident as light blue regions of smaller
pressure that intrude into the dark blue central plasma.
Tearing instabilities can be prevented by carefully heating
the plasma. Simulation data is produced with JOREK, a
nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics code.        </td>

          <p>Title: "Harnessing the power of the Sun: Magnetic reconnection in a cross-section of a realistic tokamak simulated with the JOREK code." 
          
          <p>Narrative: Fusion is a process that heats the Sun and stars. If harnessed in the future, fusion could generate large amounts of carbon-free energy. A tokamak, a machine that uses a magnetic field to confine the hot ionized gas that makes up a plasma, has the potential to produce energy using fusion. In a tokamak, plasma resistivity causes magnetic field lines to reconnect, forming magnetic islands. When a magnetic island grows to a large size, it can result in fast escape of plasma from the machine.
This image shows a cross-section of a realistic tokamak configuration with a divertor, obtained as a snapshot from a simulation with JOREK, a nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics code. A large magnetic island is created by a perturbation of the current density which is indicated by the colours: negative current perturbations are displayed by blue colours, positive current perturbations are displayed by red colours. White lines have been plotted over the current perturbation to visualize the surfaces of constant magnetic flux. Outside of the magnetic island, these surfaces are nearly concentric. The size and position of the magnetic island is indicated by the surfaces of constant magnetic flux that form isolated pockets between the concentric circles.</a>

          <p>Title: "Time-elapsed images of diffusion of tracer particles during turbulent convection." 
          
          <p>Narrative: In natural systems like stellar interiors and planetary atmospheres flows are not constrained by convection rolls or boundary layers. As well as the structure of plumes in a flow, heat transfer is highly dependent on a fluid's Prandtl number, the ratio of viscosity to thermal diffusivity. In the solar convection zone thermal diffusivity dominates, and Prandtl numbers are estimated to be 3 to 5 orders of magnitude lower than can be achieved by modern simulations. A theoretical understanding of how turbulent heat transfer changes as the Prandtl number is lowered is key to effectively modelling convection. We have developed new methods of characterizing the heat transfer in and around plumes using higher order statistics and Lagrangian tracer particles. We calculate statistics of heat transfer from pseudospectral simulations of incompressible homogeneous Boussinesq hydrodynamic convection for the wide range of Prandtl numbers.
