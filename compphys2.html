<h1 class="unnumbered" id="course-description">Course Description</h1>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Examination of mathematical methods commonly used in physics, their application to the solution of physical problems through numerical methods and algorithm development, and modern computational methods. The goal of this course is to give an introduction to methods for solving <em>difficult</em> mathematics problems that arise in physics. This requires the combination of applied mathematics with the intelligent use of numerical algorithms and computers. We will survey tools developed from probability and statistics (statistical analysis of physical data, modeling using stochastic processes, etc.) and progress toward more challenging and applied topics including Monte Carlo, stochastic optimization, and molecular dynamics.<br />
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> MATH 2215 (Multivariate Calculus) and PHYS 2212K (Principles of Physics II) with a C or higher, as well as basic familiarity with a programming language.<br />
<strong>Suggested Reference:</strong> Lucas Böttcher and Hans J. Herrmann. Computational Statistical Physics. Cambridge University Press (2021) ISBN-13: 9781108841429. ISBN-10: 1108841422

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h2>

<p>At the completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>select a satisfactory mathematical method to solve a given physics problem.</p></li>
<li><p>evaluate what error is introduced by a mathematical approximation, and what error is introduced by a numerical method.</p></li>
<li><p>understand when a result is statistically relevant.</p></li>
<li><p>compare different methods for solving physical equations.</p></li>
<li><p>understand the difference between a stochastic and deterministic method.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="academic-honesty-policy-summary">Academic Honesty Policy Summary</h1>
<p>GSU holds students to appropriate ethical and professional standards of conduct. The Policy on Academic Honesty (Section 409) exists to inform students and faculty of their obligations in upholding the highest standards of professional and ethical integrity. All student work is subject to this policy. Properly cite, reference, and attribute all intellectual property used in your coursework.</p>
<p>Online submission of, or placing one’s name on an exam, assignment, or any course document is a statement of academic honor that the student has not received or given inappropriate assistance in completing it and that the student has complied with the Policy on Academic Honesty in that work. In the event of an offense against the Policy on Academic Honesty, the instructor may impose a sanction on the student that varies depending upon the instructor’s evaluation of the nature and gravity of the offense.</p>
