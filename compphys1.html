<h1>Mathematical Methods and Computational Physics I</h1>

<p><font color="#bc8073">  This page contains selections from a recent course syllabus, with annotations, additional description, and commentary.  Please drop me an email if you have any questions.</font>


<h2 class="unnumbered" id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Examination of mathematical methods commonly used in physics, their application to the solution of physical problems through numerical methods and algorithm development, and modern computational methods. The goal of this course is to give an introduction to methods for solving <em>difficult</em> mathematics problems that arise in physics. This requires the combination of applied mathematics with the intelligent use of numerical algorithms and computers. We will start with assorted tools of the trade and simple problems (for data analysis) and progress toward more challenging topics (solving linear, nonlinear, and differential equations).<br />

<p><font color="#bc8073"> The first semester of computational physics is a survey of the most standard techniques used to solve physics problems.  These techniques all fall under the category of 'deterministic' methods. In contrast the second semester which focuses on noisy systems, noisy data, and 'stochastic' methods.</font>


<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> MATH 2215 (Multivariate Calculus) and PHYS 2212K (Principles of Physics II) with a C or higher.<br />

<p><font color="#bc8073"> We will use both integrals and derivatives in this class, and that's why there's a prereq of MATH 2215.  We'll also look at differential equations and matrix equations.  Taking classes in those areas would be a help, mostly to make the equations look familiar.  Everything you need to know about differential equations and matrix equations will be discussed in class.

<p>There aren't any classes in the curriculum that can be a prereq for coding.</font>

<p><strong>Textbook:</strong> Jaan Kiusalaas. Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python. 2nd Edition. Cambridge University Press. 2010. ISBN-13: 978-0521191326. ISBN-10: 0521191327<br />

<p><font color="#bc8073">  This is a solid textbook that covers about 80% of the material for the class with great examples.  Buying the textbook isn't required to do the assignments, but this textbook could be a big help if you're feeling out of your depth.</font>

<p><strong>Credit Hours:</strong> 3<br />
</p>

<p><font color="#bc8073">There will be regular homework assignments of 1-3 problems each week. Although there are a small number of problems, expect that you will need to spend something like 9-10 hours solving them.  They will be serious problems -- this is an advanced physics class -- and you'll need to write code to solve them.</font>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h2>
<p>At the completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>choose a satisfactory mathematical method to solve a given physics problem.</p></li>
<li><p>evaluate what error is introduced by a mathematical approximation, and what error is introduced by a numerical method.</p></li>
<li><p>understand what numerical instability is, and how to avoid it.</p></li>
<li><p>compare different methods for solving physical equations.</p></li>
<li><p>evaluate when serial or parallel computational methods are necessary.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="academic-honesty-policy-summary">Academic Honesty Policy Summary</h2>
<p>GSU holds students to appropriate ethical and professional standards of conduct. The Policy on Academic Honesty (Section 409) exists to inform students and faculty of their obligations in upholding the highest standards of professional and ethical integrity. All student work is subject to this policy. Properly cite, reference, and attribute all intellectual property used in your coursework.</p>
<p>Online submission of, or placing one’s name on an exam, assignment, or any course document is a statement of academic honor that the student has not received or given inappropriate assistance in completing it and that the student has complied with the Policy on Academic Honesty in that work. In the event of an offense against the Policy on Academic Honesty, the instructor may impose a sanction on the student that varies depending upon the instructor’s evaluation of the nature and gravity of the offense.</p>
